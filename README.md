# Doctor Demon 
> Junction 2016 Game Jam

## Inspiration
With the theme of "Resurrection", we set out to make something fun to share with a friend. We came with the idea of "possessing" the items around you, to hide and surprise your opponent!

## What it does
It's a networked, 1 vs 1 game. One player is the good guy looking to save all his doctor friends. The other one is a demon looking to take them out! It's silly and casual, but quite exciting!

## How I built it
We started by getting networking working. Then we started hacking stuff on top, feature by feature! We chose Scala, which is a pretty fast type-safe language to work with.
